This is what we are going to do today use everything that we have presented about text classification in the previous articles and comparing between the text classification models we trained in order to choose the most accurate one for our problem for models to produce general hypotheses, which then make the most accurate predictions possible about future instances. The same principles apply to text (or document) classification where there are many models can be used to train a text classifier. The answer to the question “What machine learning model should I use?” is always “It depends.” Even the most experienced data scientists can’t tell which algorithm will perform best before experimenting them
